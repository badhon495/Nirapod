      question: "How can I recover my password?",
      answer: "Click on the 'Forgotten password?' link on the login page, enter your email, and you will receive a new password in your email inbox. Make sure to check your spam/junk folder if you don't see it in your main inbox."
    },
    {
      question: "I did not receive the OTP. What should I do?",
      answer: "Please check your spam/junk folder first. If you still don't receive the OTP, ensure your email address is correct and try requesting it again. Sometimes there might be a slight delay due to network issues."
    },
    {
      question: "What file types can I upload for NID, Driving License, etc.?",

    },
    {
      question: "How do I track my complaint?",
